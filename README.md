# G00384389@atu.ie Emerging Technologies Repository

## Introduction
This notebook aims to demonstrate my ability in the following areas:

-Detect new and emerging technologies in computing through reputable sources.

-Contextualize an emerging technology by identifying its origins and proponents.

-Research an emerging technology in order to use it.

-Implement a solution to a computing problem using an emerging technology.

# Tasks
## Task 1
**Task 1 Definition**<br>
>Select five free English works in Plain Text UTF8 format from Project Gutenberg. Use them to create a model of the English language as follows. Remove any preamble and postamble. Remove all characters except for (ASCII) letters (uppercase and lowercase), full stops, and spaces. Make all letters uppercase.

>Next create a trigram model by counting the number of times each sequence of three characters (that is, each trigram) appears. You can design your own data structure for storing the results but explain your design and its rationale in your answer.

### My Approach
| Step     | Description     |
|--------------|--------------|
| T1.0  |  I chose five suitable texts from Project Gutenberg and saved them as text files |
| T1.1 |  I then read the texts into file and stored them in list 'texts' |
|  T1.2| I then combined all the text to one file 'combined_text'  |
| T1.3 | I then cleaned the text the text       
| T1.4 | With the cleaned text I generated a Trigram Model of the English lanuguage  |
|   T1.5 |  Next I sorted the trigrams and stored them in descending order based on frequency.   |
|T1.6  | Finally I saved the trigram model to a text file.  |
