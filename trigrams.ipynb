    "## Task 1\n",
    "This part of the notebook aims to create a third-order letter approximation model using five English works in Plain Text UTF8 format from Project Gutenberg for my module Emerging Technologies in final year. The task is outlined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select five free English works in Plain Text UTF8 format from Project Gutenberg. Use them to create a model of the English language as follows. Remove any preamble and postamble. Remove all characters except for (ASCII) letters (uppercase and lowercase), full stops, and spaces. Make all letters uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next create a trigram model by counting the number of times each sequence of three characters (that is, each trigram) appears. You can design your own data structure for storing the results but explain your design and its rationale in your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence: It is what it is. would become IT IS WHAT IT IS. This will give a model like {'IT ': 2, 'T I': 3, ' IS': 2, 'IS ': 1, ...}.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have broken this down to the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selecting five texts from books I have gotten from https://www.gutenberg.org/.\n",
    "2. Cleaning the texts by removing preamble, postamble, and unnecessary characters.\n",
    "3. Converting the texts to uppercase.\n",
    "(Step 3 & 4 are to prepare the file for processing in the trigram model)\n",
    "4. Creating a trigram model by counting sequences of three consecutive characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigrams are sequences of three characters, and the goal is to use trigrams to analyze the structure of the English language. Each trigram's frequency will be recorded to create a model for the English language."
